## FAQ

* **Why is this class useful?**
  The API allows SVGs as icons, but only a single path. I had a use case of a complex image that needed look great at about 50x50 pixels. SVG fits this, but the SVGs required multiple paths and multiple colors. I couldn't find a simple overlay class, so I created my own.
